# GnomeLand EthGlobal

GnomeLand is a MultiChain indie game leveraging Layer0 cross-chain messaging and the gamification of  Concentrated Liquidity management.

This project was born from an idea on ETHLisbon hackathon to create a zapper contract that adds concentrated Liquidity with the minting fee of the player NFT.

We chose to come to the ETHGlobal London with this project for the brainstorming effect atmosphere this event create, and to get guidance, tips and feedback to keep building and improving our ecossystem.
